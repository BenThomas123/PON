# Security Documentation

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the project.

## Key Features
1. **TLS Encryption:** Ensures secure communication between devices.
2. **Secure Boot:** Verifies firmware integrity at boot time.
3. **Key Management:** Manages cryptographic keys securely.
4. **Authentication:** Implements username-password-based authentication.

## Best Practices
- Rotate cryptographic keys periodically.
- Regularly update firmware to address vulnerabilities.
- Monitor logs for unauthorized access attempts.

## Threat Mitigation
- **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:** Mitigated using TLS.
- **Firmware Tampering:** Mitigated using secure boot.
- **Unauthorized Access:** Mitigated through strong authentication mechanisms.
